All sourcecode is stored in the src/main folder. all unit tests are stored in the src/test folder.

To build the program you need to run the build-install script with the Bash shell. The script cleans the build folder and builds the program.
The script creates an install folder for the program outside the TicTacToe_2016 directory.

The TicTacToe-installed directory contains documentation and necessary jar files. There are two scripts in the TicTacToe-installed/TicTacToe_2016/bin directory that are used to run the program. The .bat script is for Windows and the .sh script is for Linux.
